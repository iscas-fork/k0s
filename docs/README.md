# k0s - The Zero Friction Kubernetes

![k0s logo](img/k0s-logo-full-color-light.svg)

k0s is an open source, all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster. Due to its simple design, flexible deployment options and modest system requirements, k0s is well suited for

- Any cloud
- Bare metal
- Edge and IoT

k0s drastically reduces the complexity of installing and running a CNCF certified Kubernetes distribution. With k0s new clusters can be bootstrapped in minutes and developer friction is reduced to zero. This allows anyone with no special skills or expertise in Kubernetes to easily get started.

k0s is distributed as a single binary with zero host OS dependencies besides the host OS kernel. It works with any Linux without additional software packages or configuration. Any security vulnerabilities or performance issues can be fixed directly in the k0s distribution that makes it extremely straightforward to keep the clusters up-to-date and secure.

## What happened to Github stargazers?

In September 2022 we made a human error while creating some build automation scripts&tools for the Github repository. Our automation accidentally changed the repo to a private one for few minutes. That itself is not a big deal and everything was restored quickly. But the nasty side effect is that it also removed all the stargazers at that point. :(

Before that mishap we had 4776 stargazers, making k0s one of the most popular Kubernetes distro out there.

**So if you are reading this, and have not yet starred [k0s repo](https://github.com/iscas-fork/k0s/) we would highly appreciate the :star: to get our numbers closer to what they used to be.**
